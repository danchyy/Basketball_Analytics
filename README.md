# Basketball Analytics

This repository and scripts in it will be focusing on the statistics revolving around NBA and basketball in general.

All code is written in Python using the Jupyter Notebooks which allow live preview of the images and thus making it nice and easy to analyze and visualize data.

Current mini "projects":

* Assists distribution between each NBA team for 2016/2017 season
	* [Crawler](https://github.com/danchyy/ML-and-DS/blob/master/Scripts/assist_distribution_between_team/assistCrawler.ipynb) which cleans table of assists inside team from basketball-reference site

	* [Notebook](https://github.com/danchyy/ML-and-DS/blob/master/Scripts/assist_distribution_between_team/visualize_assists.ipynb) to visualize assists distribution using heatmaps

* Visualization of best 3 point shooters on very tight, tight, open and wide open defense
	* [Notebook](https://github.com/danchyy/ML-and-DS/blob/master/Scripts/closest_defenders_shot_chart/closest_defenders_percentage.ipynb)  to compare shooters based on closest defender

* Shotcharts from past 2017 Eurobasket comparing Bogdanovics and displaying Markkanen's shooting ability

* Inspired by Aaron Gordon's first 40 point game, I took a look at how other young players his age, or younger, improved during their first 40 point game (only the ones which aren't rookies)

	* [Notebook](https://github.com/danchyy/Basketball_Analytics/blob/master/Scripts/young_players_40_point_breaktrough/comparison_of_young_players_season.ipynb) Which visualizes players improvement in points per game during the season in which they scored 40 points or more.

* Radar plots which describe player's style.

	* [Notebook](https://github.com/danchyy/Basketball_Analytics/blob/master/Scripts/radar_plot/Radar_plot.ipynb) with radar plots showing for Russell Westbrook and Kyrie Irving to view how they adapted to newly added teammates (Westbrook) and new team (for Kyrie).
